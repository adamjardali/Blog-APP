# Blog-APP
This Blog App is built on the Django framework, which allows users to easily sign in and sign out. In addition to standard CRUD operations for user profiles, I've implemented a robust password reset feature that securely sends an email to the user for account recovery. The app's code has been developed with the best practices in mind and optimized with class-based views for superior performance. While inspired by Corey Schafer's work, I've added new features and made improvements to the project for a better user experience.
